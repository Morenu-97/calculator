# Calculator
This is my first project!
This is my first project! This first version of the calculator works on the basis of a while loop, which allows the calculator to stay on until the user decides to turn it off. It performs the following operations:
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division
- Radication
- Absolute value.
