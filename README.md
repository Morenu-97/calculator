# Calculator ðŸ”¢âž•âž–âœ–âž—ðŸ”¢
Â¡This is my first project! It is divided into two versions:
The first version of the calculator, located in the Main class, works on the basis of a while loop, which allows the calculator to remain on until the user decides to turn it off. It performs the following operations:
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division
- Radication
- Absolute value 

The second version located in the calculator builder class, is closer to a real calculator, since you can enter the operation in a single line, also saves the result for further use. The operation must be entered with a space in between, example: 5 * 5. It performs the following operations:
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division
